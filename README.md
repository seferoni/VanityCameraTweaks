# Overview﻿
﻿Kingmaker's codebase reveals that zoom functionality was to be implemented for the vanity camera (which displays the player 'doll' in the inventory screen). This never came to pass, and remains non-functional as of v2.1.7b.

In its current state (v1.0.0), this mod does the following:
﻿
- Restores and fixes on-scroll zoom functionality for the doll camera,
- Adjusts doll camera behaviour based on the height/race of the player doll,
- Fixes the 'hand raised' animation bug caused when only the main-hand has a weapon equipped (and vice-versa),
- Forces a relaxed/peaceful idle animation when all weapons are unequipped.

# Configuration
Through interfacing with UMM (use CTRL + F10 to access its menu), this mod provides the following configuration options:
﻿
 - A fine offset for the zoom, so as to provide minor & persistent adjustments to the camera position,
 - A toggle for the animation fixes.

# Installation
Unzip the archive and place the 'Vanity Camera Tweaks' folder into Pathfinder: Kingmaker/Mods.

This mod serialises no data, and so can be safely installed or uninstalled from an ongoing playthrough.

# Dependencies
This mod requires Unity Mod Manager v0.32.2 or later. Earlier builds may work, but are unsupported.
